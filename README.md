This study investigates the use of sophisticated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with an emphasis on the Conditional GAN (CGAN), Conditional Progressive GAN (CPGAN), and StyleGAN architectures, in the creation of synthetic images for datasets related to oral diseases. By using these GAN models, we want to improve the caliber and variety of photos that are produced. We evaluate each model's ability to produce realistic and varied images using a thorough qualitative and quantitative study that includes Diversity Score, Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), and classification accuracy and F1 Score using ResNet50. The findings show that although each model delivers advantages in picture synthesis, their performance characteristics are different. In addition to offering helpful insights into the relative advantages and disadvantages of CGAN, CPGAN, and StyleGAN, this paper makes recommendations for future directions in medical image synthesis research
